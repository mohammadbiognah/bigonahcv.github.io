    title: RESEARCH TECHNIQUES
    summary: |
      My research interests include new techniques in modelling and 
      Improve [Progressive Collapse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_collapse) 
      methods for structures,Moreover, Network Resilience, with the goal of 
      contributing to disaster prevention and mitigation. These research topics
      "Believe Rule  Base with [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning),
      artificial Intelligence, as well as Smart technologies.I also have expertise 
      in  Seismic Retrofitting of Structural Vibration Controls and bridges and high-rise buildings.
